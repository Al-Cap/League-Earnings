However, popularity for certain games are higher than others does not mean a higher prize. The uptake of of leagues spreads all across the globe. Many the large countries and a some small ones are competing in these leagues. Determining which league is important to consider. Whether it is for you are not might depend on the earnings, or the amount of tournaments done.

## Data

The data was used from [https://www.esportsearnings.com/leagues](https://www.esportsearnings.com/leagues). The raw data consists of the kind of tournaments, earnings, players, amount of tournaments and events.

The compiled data in to a table can be seen [here](https://github.com/Al-Cap/League-Earnings/blob/main/data/leagues.csv).

## Modeling

The data was broken down to compare the amount of tournaments to players, earnings to players, and earnings to amount of tournaments.

Amount of tournaments to players:

Earnings to players:

Earnings to aamount of tournaments:

## Results

The graphes are show that the least amount of tournaments have the higher concentration of players and earnings. This shows that the amount of tournaments needed to attract players or amount of earnings available are more determined on the game and not the amount of players invovled or the amount of tournaments are hosted. 
 
## Future

Simialr methods can be done to determine how to enter Esport leagues. A further look into leagues would be easier with th use of which games are the most profitable, showcased, and have a high player base. Other factors can be added to narrow the search. Depends on what is trying to be found will determine the methods and variables used to find which league provides the most benefit.
